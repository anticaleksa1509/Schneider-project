The Email Service was developed to provide reliable and asynchronous email notifications across the microservice ecosystem.

Core features:

Message-driven design

Uses ActiveMQ queues to receive events from other services (e.g., Auth Service, Sports Booking Service).

Ensures loose coupling: business services only publish events, while Email Service handles all communication with SMTP.

Email delivery

Implemented with Springâ€™s JavaMailSender.

Supports HTML and plain-text emails.

Configurable SMTP settings for different environments.

Asynchronous processing

Email requests are queued and processed independently, avoiding delays in main service execution.

Retries and error handling mechanisms ensure high reliability.

Scalability & statelessness

The service is fully stateless; multiple instances can be run in parallel to handle large volumes of email traffic.

Horizontally scalable with message queue load balancing.

Error handling & monitoring

Failed email attempts are logged for auditing and troubleshooting.

Integration with monitoring tools for tracking email delivery success/failure rates.
